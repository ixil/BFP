## Introduction

The ETH Zürich's Student Project House's "Bulky but Fabulous Printer" - (BFP) is a large H-bot style FDM printer with a build volume of 1㎥ ( 0.8 × 1.2 × 1.1 ).
It was built by members of the [Student Project House (SPH)](https://sph.ethz.ch/big3d/) and
is intended to be used by any user of the SPH (after a machine introduction).
<!-- It is currently a FDM printer, although are ideas for extending the print end to accommodate other materials to take advantage of the large print volume. -->

## Features

 - Large build volume 1㎥ ( 0.8 × 1.2 × 1.1 )
 - Capable of large volumetric flow rates
 - High speed linear motion system
 - Heated Bed
 - Removable print bed
 - [80W E3D Volcano hot end](https://e3d-online.com/collections/hotends/products/supervolcano-upgrade-kit)
 - Can print wide range of FDM materials (PLA to PEEK)
 - Auto mesh bed leveling
 - Large Spool holder
 - Print heads can be swapped
 - Cura slicer

## Compatibility

 - 

## Bill Of materials

## Printed parts

Many parts were printed, see here for a list including the STL / CAD files.

## Print settings

Finding the right print settings is a time consuming task.
For PTE the following settings in CURA are used.

## Credit and Thanks

This project would have not been possible without the generous support of our sponsors:

 - [HiWin](https://www.hiwin.com/index.html "HiWin") - for linear movement components, to ensure BFP is *Fast*, and *Beautiful*,
 - [Duet3D](https://www.duet3d.com/ "Duet3D") - for the electronics that control the printer is *Fast*,
 - [Item](https://www.item24.ch/en/ "Item24") - for the aluminium profiles that gives the printer so much *Beauty*.

Of course credit also must go to the Student Project House, for funding and providing the tools and space for our *Big*, *Fantastic* Printer.

Also thanks to those that helped in the design, construction, and assembly of the printer:

 - [Andreas Perssinitto](https://github.com/periandr)  - Led the design and was there from start to finish,
 - Killian Hanke,
 - [Oliver Harley](https://github.com/ixil),
 - (There are more who should go here)
